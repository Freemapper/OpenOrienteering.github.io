The example maps for OO Mapper now include a complete orienteering map. It is a sprint map showing the town center of the university town Garching bei München in Germany. The map has been completely drawn with OpenOrienteering Mapper, and the first race on it has already taken place. The file will come with the next Mapper release and is also available from [here](/assets/2013/complete-map.xmap_.zip).

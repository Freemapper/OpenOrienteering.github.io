Due to the U.S. Federal government shutdown,Â the online lookup of magnetic declination is not available. NOAA.gov redirects to [http://governmentshutdown.noaa.gov/](http://governmentshutdown.noaa.gov/). Mapper's error message won't give you a clear indication, but this is a minor problem in that context.

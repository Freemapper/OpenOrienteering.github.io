A translation of Mapper to Czech is now available:
[Download Czech translation for Mapper 0.5.3](http://sourceforge.net/projects/oorienteering/files/Mapper/0.5.3/translations/OpenOrienteering_cs.qm/download)
The file may be loaded into Mapper by opening the settings dialog, clicking the folder icon to the right of the language selector, and choosing the downloaded file.

**Update**: the symbol sets have now been translated too.
[Download Czech symbol sets for Mapper 0.5.3](http://sourceforge.net/projects/oorienteering/files/Mapper/0.5.3/translations/symbol_sets_cs.zip/download)
They can be used as symbol sets for new maps by selecting "Load symbol set from a file ..." while creating the new map. Alternatively, the files can be placed in the "symbol sets" folder of your Mapper installation which makes them show up in the symbol sets list for new maps. For existing maps, the symbol set can be replaced using the Symbols -> Replace symbol set... menu item.

The translation was created by **[Pavel Fric](http://fripohled.blogspot.cz)**. Thanks a lot for contributing!

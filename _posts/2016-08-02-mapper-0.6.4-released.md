Mapper v0.6.4 brings bugfixes and improvements. It contains [170 commits since 0.6.3, changing 129 source files](https://github.com/OpenOrienteering/mapper/compare/v0.6.3...v0.6.4). The most important changes are:

 - Add a [symbol set for course design and control description sheets](http://www.openorienteering.org/mapper-manual/pages/course_design.html)
 - Add Dutch and Portugese (Brazil) translations
 - Improve many other translations
 - Fix wrong symbol sizes in translated symbol sets
 - Don't corrupt view settings after printing or export
 

Note that this release does not yet include GDAL-based importers. This work-in-progress remains available with the "unstable" builds.

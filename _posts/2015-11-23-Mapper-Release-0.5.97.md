OpenOrienteering Mapper Release 0.5.97 is now available for download. It contains a lot of changes over the previous version. Most of the work was internal restructuring which shall improve maintainability but remain invisible. But there are also interesting new features since 0.5.96:

 - PDF export with CMYK colors ([#482](https://github.com/OpenOrienteering/mapper/issues/482))
 - Georeferencing with EPSG code

For Windows, OS X, and Android, the updated Qt library (version 5.5.1) improves the support for the newer version of these operating systems.

After many hours of work, the second alpha version of OpenOrienteering Mapper has been released today. Highlights of this version include:



	
  * Import of OCAD 8 files, including symbol sets

	
  * Addition of the text drawing tool

	
  * Many new editing tools

	
  * German translation


You can read the [full changelog here](/assets/2012/alpha2-changes.txt).

**Note**
Even though this version represents a huge improvement over the first alpha, we still do not recommend to use it for map projects because the planned OCAD export feature and some basic editing tools are still missing. As far as it can be judged now, the next version after this one could include these and be the first version which will be recommended for mapping.

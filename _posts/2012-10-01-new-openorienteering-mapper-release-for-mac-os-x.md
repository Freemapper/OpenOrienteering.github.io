We are glad to release a Mac OS X package again, thanks to great support from Oskar Karlin. Bringing the Mac OS X version on par with Windows and Ubuntu took a number of changes to the code and to the build system, collected in release 0.3.2.



	
  * Mac OS X users and new users shall use the new Mapper release 0.3.2.

	
  * For users of Mapper release 0.3.1, there is no need to upgrade to 0.3.2.


Note that we still have no permanent [package maintainer for Mac OS X](https://sourceforge.net/p/oorienteering/tickets/96/), i.e. someone who will do the next release packages.

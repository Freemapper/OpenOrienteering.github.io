Today comes just a short progress report to show that we are still alive ;-)
Development is currently going on slower than before, but apart from the usual bugfixes and smaller improvements some features have been added since the last update nevertheless. These are:



	
  * The cut tool to split lines in two, remove segments from lines or cut areas into two parts

	
  * The 'cut hole' tool to cut holes into areas

	
  * Translation infrastructure and German translation covering most of the currently existing texts, contributed by Kai Pastor

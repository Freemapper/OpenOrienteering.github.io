Version 0.5.97 seems to work quite well. Some issues were reported and fixed, so the current unstable packages (for Windows and Linux) are even more mature than this preview release. The documentation finally got some updates, too. It now lives in its [own repository](https://github.com/OpenOrienteering/mapper-manual) on Github, which is also the base of the [online manual](http://openorienteering.org/mapper-manual/).

The implementation of the template setup window was heavily modified. Now this dialog is used in the Android version, too. In the next release of the mobile version, it will be possible to change the stacking order of the templates and also to adjust the opacity.

No longer a "preview" release! Mapper v0.6.0 is finally ready. It contains a lot of work especially since 0.5.3, and [70 commits since 0.5.97](https://github.com/OpenOrienteering/mapper/compare/v0.5.97...v0.6.0). I would like to repeat and extend the list of highlights:

- PDF export with CMYK colors (#482)
- Georeferencing with EPSG code, even for EPSG 5514 (#542)
- Revised template dialog on Android (#493)
- Translation updates (#346)
- Documentation updates (#347, work in progress)

Find [all resoved issues on Github](https://github.com/OpenOrienteering/mapper/issues?q=milestone:v0.6.0+is:closed).
[Known issues in 0.6.0](https://github.com/OpenOrienteering/mapper/issues?q=label:"known issues 0.6.0") will be collected there, too.

We have to say a big THANK YOU to all the contributors. In the last months, the number of contributions started to increase. We are glad that we could add a few new names to the list.

An online betting system for orienteering competitions developed by Thomas Schöps is now publicly available, after it has been successfully tested at the Bavarian Long Distance Championships. It is only available in German for now.

The web application uses PHP and MySQL. It works together with the SportSoftware programs OE2003 and OE2010, relay races are not supported. Creating a new betting contest and calculating the results is as easy as generating and uploading a CSV export file from the SportSoftware application.

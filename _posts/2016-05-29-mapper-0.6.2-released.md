Mapper v0.6.2 brings bugfixes and improvement. It contains [205 commits since 0.6.1, changing 277 files](https://github.com/OpenOrienteering/mapper/compare/v0.6.1...v0.6.2). We want to highlight the following additions:

 - ISMTBOM and ISSkiOM symbol sets
 - Settings dialog and translations now also in the Android version
 - Detailed printer properties available on Windows
 - Import of OCD version 12
 - Grid scale factor

Note that this release does not yet include GDAL-based importers. This work-in-progress remains available with the "unstable" builds.

Find [all resoved issues on Github](https://github.com/OpenOrienteering/mapper/issues?q=milestone:v0.6.2+is:closed).
[Known issues in 0.6.2](https://github.com/OpenOrienteering/mapper/issues?q=label:"known issues 0.6.2") will be collected there, too.

Thanks to all the contributors!

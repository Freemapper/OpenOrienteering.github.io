{% include image src="/assets/2013/templates-300x189.png" caption="Working with templates in OpenOrienteering Mapper 0.5.3" href="/assets/2013/templates.png" %}OpenOrienteering Mapper 0.5.3 is now available for Windows, OS X, Ubuntu 12.04 Precise and _Debian 7 Wheezy (amd64 only)_. Release 0.5.3 is a maintenance release which brings bug fixes and minor improvements to Mapper's features. However, the underlying Qt framework was updated to the latest stable version.

We recommend the update for all users of previous version. We believe that this release will be running very stable. However, it is recommended to keep backups of files which you modify with the program.

**Major changes in 0.5.3
**



	
  * The import of OCD version 11, 10, and 9 files was further tested and improved.

	
  * The updated Norwegian translation is now included in the packages.

	
  * The Qt framework was updated to version 5.1.1. This version fixes a number of issues, especially on OS X. But it might also introduce new problems.

	
  * On Windows, the build tools were updated to a GCC 4.8.0 toolchain (the reference platform for Qt 5.1).

	
  * On OS X, the build tools wereÂ updated to XCode 4.5.2.

**Note for Mac users**

The original "0.5.3" package works on Mac OS X 10.7 or newer. We later added a second package "0.5.3.1" which runs on Mac OS X 10.6 (or newer).
For systems with activated Gatekeeper (10.8 Mountain Lion and partly also 10.7 Lion) the app has to be started once by right clinking on the file and choosing Open. This is because it is not code signed, which would require an annual license fee.

**Reporting bugs
**

The [Bug tracker](https://sourceforge.net/p/oorienteering/tickets/) is the right place to lookup and report all kinds of issues with the program. You may also submit feature requests here.

**Contributing**

The [user wiki](https://sourceforge.net/p/oorienteering/wiki/Home/) is pre-filled with the program manual. If you have hints to share with the mapper community or want to extend the program documentation, please create a SourceForge account and start editing it.

If you are interested in writing a translation, find more information in a [developer wiki page](http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/oorienteering/index.php?title=Translation). There are no programming skills required!

If you are a programmer with experience in C++ / Qt, or want to help in any other way, we would like to welcome you at our [developer mailing list](https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/oorienteering-devel). Useful places with resources are:



	
  * [Git repository](https://sourceforge.net/p/oorienteering/code/) with the latest code

	
  * [Developer wiki](https://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/oorienteering/index.php?title=Main_Page) with information about the code, or how to start a new translation

In the meantime I built the [ISOM 2000](http://orienteering.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/International-Specification-for-Orienteering-Maps-2000.pdf) foot-o symbol set in OpenOrienteering Mapper, except the overprinting symbols, because there is no course setting support planned for the near future (I recommend [Purple Pen](http://purplepen.golde.org/) for that task). All of the symbols should display correctly, apart from any mistakes. Working with the program to create the symbol set allowed me to find and fix a lot of bugs and usability problems.

In addition to that, it is now possible to draw point and path objects on the map and there is a basic edit tool to adjust their control points. All of the tools show a neat live preview of the objects that are drawn. You will soon be able to try it yourself easily because I plan to release a first preview version for Windows the next days (well, I think that I should at least try to counteract the announcement of the OCAD 11 beta a bit ;-) ). There are only a few things missing that I want to add beforehand. For now, here are two screenshots:

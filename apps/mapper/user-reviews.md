> I've been using the Android version for my fieldwork since late 2014 : I changed to using a tablet when I started to have trouble with drafting film on complicated areas, where I need to rub out a lot. I use a Samsung Galaxy Note 2014 10.1 because of the thin S-Pen stylus, perfect for drawing ; the battery doesn't last all day, only about 5 hours, so I use a second tablet to get a full day. A Garmin GLO receiver works pretty well in the forest, for the price, though I've gone on to use a more expensive Ublox device. I've also tried OOM on an old Panasonic FZ A1 toughpad, you can find them for around 500 euros : they're rugged, they also have a really good thin stylus, but the hardware is a bit slow (loading and saving files). The software is great, just a few trivial bugs barely worth mentioning. Because it's free and runs on Android, you can take a chance and invest the time needed to change your working method. It doesn't especially speed up fieldworking, but drawing up the fieldwork in the evening is quite a bit quicker. A big thank you to all involved.

> I draw with desktop version map for school competition without problems. As a long term OCAD user I can say that some functionality is even better in OO Mapper. At android version I am personally missing several functions to be more productive than when I am mapping on the desk, but still it is great tool for mapping. Thank you OOM team!

> Unlike OCAD this software runs beautifully on a Linux system. It is stable and while the interface is different that has many benefits and once learned is easy to use and fast. Large files (high resolution background images) are handled well and the control of display options is excellent. I use this for all my mapping now.

> Now, with version 0.5.0, it is a replacement for OCAD 8. Similar features and better handling. Can be used productively. I drew a full map with it.

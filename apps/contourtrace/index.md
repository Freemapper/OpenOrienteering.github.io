[**Download here!**](http://sourceforge.net/projects/oorienteering/files/ContourTrace/)

**ContourTrace** is a small extension to the [AutoTrace](http://autotrace.sourceforge.net/) program which makes it useful to extract contours from raster images, ready for import into vector drawing programs (which orienteering mapping programs are). The download archive contains both the Windows and Linux version and instructions in English and German.
